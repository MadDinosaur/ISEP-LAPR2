# Use Cases / User Stories
| UC/US  | Name | Actor | Description

| US13 | [Validate the clinical analysis](US13.md) | Laboratory Coordinator | Display the chemical test/result and associated diagnosis for validation. |
| US14 | [View results](US14.md) | Client  | Notify by SMS and e-mail when results are available. Display the results. |
| US15 | [Check results](US15.md) | Medical Lab Technician, Clinical Chemistry Technologist, Specialist Doctor, Laboratory Coordinator | Display the result information to all actors. |
