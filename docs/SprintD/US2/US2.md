# US 2 -  Update Client Personal Data

## 1. Requirements Engineering

### 1.1. User Story Description

As a client, I want to update my personal data.

### 1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications 

**From the Specifications Document:**
* Client personal data is as follows: 
  
  *"To register a client, the receptionist needs the clientâ€™s citizen card number, National Healthcare Service (NHS) number, birth date, sex, Tax Identification number (TIF), phone number, e-mail and name."*

**From the client clarifications:**
* **Q1: Should the Client type in the attribute he/she wants to update or should he choose from a list?**
  
  **Q2: To update the attribute, should the Client type the previous data?**
  
  **Q3: What is the Data that the Client can update?**
  
  **A:** In this sprint each team should develop a graphical user interface for US2. The application should show the current user data and the client can update any attribute.

### 1.3. Acceptance Criteria

* **AC1:** The client can update any attribute.
* **AC2:** The client should be able to login with new credentials.
* **AC3:** The team should develop a graphical user interface.

### 1.4. Found out Dependencies

* **US3:** Register a client.

### 1.5 Input and Output Data

**Input Data**
* **Typed data:** name, card number, NHS number, birth date, TIN, phone number, e-mail and password. 
* **Selected data:** sex

**Output Data**
* Current personal data
* (In)Success of the operation

### 2.2. Other Remarks

*Use this section to capture some aditional notes/remarks that must be taken into consideration into the design activity. In some case, it might be usefull to add other analysis artifacts (e.g. activity or state diagrams).* 



## 3. Design - User Story Realization 

### 3.1. Rationale

**The rationale grounds on the SSD interactions and the identified input/output data.**

| Interaction ID | Question: Which class is responsible for... | Answer  | Justification (with patterns)  |
|:-------------  |:--------------------- |:------------|:---------------------------- |
|...|
*Note: IE - Information Expert*

### Systematization ##

According to the taken rationale, the conceptual classes promoted to software classes are: 

 * ...

Other software classes identified: 
 * UpdateClientDataUI (applying the Pure Fabrication pattern)  
 * UpdateClientDataController (applying the Pure Fabrication pattern)

# 4. Tests 

# 5. Construction (Implementation)

*In this section, it is suggested to provide, if necessary, some evidence that the construction/implementation is in accordance with the previously carried out design. Furthermore, it is recommeded to mention/describe the existence of other relevant (e.g. configuration) files and highlight relevant commits.*

*It is also recommended to organize this content by subsections.* 

# 6. Integration and Demo 

*In this section, it is suggested to describe the efforts made to integrate this functionality with the other features of the system.*


# 7. Observations

*In this section, it is suggested to present a critical perspective on the developed work, pointing, for example, to other alternatives and or future related work.*
