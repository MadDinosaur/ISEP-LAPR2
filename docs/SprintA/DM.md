# OO Analysis #

The construction process of the domain model is based on the client specifications, especially the nouns (for _concepts_) and verbs (for _relations_) used.

**OBS**

The generalization classes **Employee** and **Laboratory** were not considered in this Domain Model. Despite the existence of company roles and places with common attributes that fall into these conceptual classes, they weren't used for simplicity's sake and to preserve readability in the graphical representation.

These classes might be considered, however, in the Design phase of this project.
